/*The	Fibonacci	numbers sequence, Fn,	is defined	as	follows:
*F1 is	1,	F2 is	1,	and	Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 for	n =	3,	4,	5,	...	
*In	other	words,	each	number	is	the	sum	of	the	previous	two	
*numbers.	The	first	10	numbers	
*in	Fibonacci	sequence	are: 1,	1,	2,	3,	5,	8,	13,	21,	34,	55
*1. Write a function int fib(int n) that returns the n-th element of the 
*Fibonacci sequence.
*2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer 
*num, and then prints the numâ€™s elements in the Fibonacci sequence.
*Your	program	should	interact	with	the	user	exactly as	it	
*shows	in	the	following	example:
*Please	enter	a	positive	integer: 7
*13
