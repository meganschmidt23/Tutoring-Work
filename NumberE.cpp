/*The number e is an important mathematical constant that is the 
* base of the natural logarithm. e also arises in the study of 
* compound interest, and in many other applications.
* The value of e is approximately equal to 2.71828. We can get an 
* approximate value of e, by calculating only a partial sum of the 
* infinite sum above (the more addends we add, the better
* approximation we get).
* Implement the function:
* double eApprox(int n)
* This function is given a positive integer n, and returns an 
* approximation of e, calculated by the sum of the first (n+1)
* addends of the infinite sum above.
* Notes:
* 1. Pay attention to the running time of eApprox. An efficient 
* implementation would run in Î˜(n).
* 2. Since the values of the factorials will grow to be very large, 
* use a variable of type double to store them.
